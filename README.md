# RNA-Seq-Deconvolution
 This GitHub repository provides an implementation of RNA-Seq deconvolution algorithms for estimating cell-type proportions from bulk RNA-Seq data. Deconvolution is a powerful computational technique that allows researchers to infer the cellular composition of heterogeneous samples based on gene expression profiles.
